# Traffic Events Informer

Traffic Events Informer (TEI) is a mobile application which notifies you about new traffic events on road, such as traffic accidents, road maintenance etc. It also notifies you when traffic events end. Traffic data are fetched from [Directorate of Roads and Highways of the Czech Republic API](https://mobilitydata.rsd.cz/), therefore TEI is only usable for roads in Czech Republic. The application is suitable for anyone who wants to know what is happening on the roads they regularly drive through. If the driver is notified about a new traffic event, he can choose an alternative route, or he can drive more carefully in the section where the traffic event is taking place.

## How to use

In order for the application to be usable, it is necessary to import a file with route coordinates first. You can get this file from [mapy.cz](https://mapy.cz/) web page or from their [mobile application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.seznam.mapy) (screenshots below were taken from mobile application). To get the application up and running, follow these steps:

1. Enter your route to mapy.cz
